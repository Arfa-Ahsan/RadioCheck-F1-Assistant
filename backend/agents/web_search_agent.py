def tavily_search(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Search the web for current, accurate, and factual Formula 1 information using Tavily.
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. ALWAYS verify current information - F1 lineups and teams change frequently
    2. ALWAYS provide SOURCE URLs in your response - never give info without citing sources
    3. Include EXACT Grand Prix name for race-specific queries (DNFs, incidents, results)
    
    KEY EXAMPLES:
    
    Example 1 - Team Changes (2025 season):
        WRONG: Search "Lewis Hamilton team" 
        CORRECT: Search "Lewis Hamilton team 2025 current" ‚Üí He's at Ferrari now, not Mercedes
    
    Example 2 - Race-Specific Queries (DNFs, incidents):
        WRONG: Search "Oscar Piastri DNF 2025"
        CORRECT: Search "Oscar Piastri DNF Azerbaijan Grand Prix 2025" ‚Üí Include exact race name
    
    Example 3 - Response Format (ALWAYS include sources):
        "Lewis Hamilton drives for Ferrari in 2025 alongside Charles Leclerc.
        
        Sources:
        - Formula1.com: [URL]
        - Autosport: [URL]"
    
    SEARCH TIPS:
    - Always include "2025" or "current season" in queries
    - Use full Grand Prix names (e.g., "Azerbaijan Grand Prix" not "Baku")
    - For DNFs/incidents: "driver name DNF/incident [Grand Prix Name] 2025"
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Never assume historical data is current. Always verify the latest information.
